## Building a Scalable Uber-like Application with Go, gRPC, and Kafka

Embarking on the development of a ride-sharing application using a modern, scalable backend architecture is a robust undertaking. This guide provides a high-level overview, a recommended project structure, and initial steps to build your Uber-like application using:

- **Go** for microservices
- **gRPC** for inter-service communication
- **Kafka** for event-driven processing
- **Tilt**, **Minikube**, and **Kubernetes** for a cloud-native development environment

### Core Technology Overview

Here's a brief look at the role of each component in your technology stack:

- **Go (Golang):** Simplicity, high performance, and excellent support for concurrency make it a strong choice for scalable microservices.
- **gRPC:** High-performance, open-source universal RPC framework for synchronous, efficient, and strongly-typed communication between internal microservices.
- **Apache Kafka:** Distributed event streaming platform for asynchronous communication and central event processing (e.g., trip requests, location updates).
- **API Gateway:** Single entry point for all client requests; handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing to backend services.
- **Kubernetes (k8s):** Container orchestration platform for deploying, scaling, and managing microservices in a production-like environment.
- **Minikube:** Run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally for development and testing.
- **Tilt.dev:** Automates and optimizes the development workflow for multi-service applications on Kubernetes, providing smart rebuilds and live updates.

### Proposed Microservices

For a simplified start, focus on three core services:

- **Gateway Service:** Public-facing entry point. Exposes a REST or GraphQL API for client applications (rider and driver apps) and translates requests into gRPC calls to internal services.
- **Driver Service:** Manages driver-related data and logic (profiles, availability, location updates).
- **Trip Service:** Handles the lifecycle of a trip, from creation and driver matching to managing ongoing trip status.

### Folder Breakdown

- **api/proto:** Protocol Buffer (`.proto`) files defining gRPC services and message types. Version your API from the start (e.g., `v1`).
- **cmd:** Entry points for each microservice. Each `main.go` initializes and starts its respective service.
- **internal:** Private application and library code. The Go compiler prevents external imports from this directory. Each service has its own subdirectory containing core logic.
  - **handler:** gRPC server implementations handling incoming requests.
  - **service:** Business logic for each service.
  - **repository:** Data persistence and database abstraction.
- **pkg:** Shared code across microservices (e.g., common data models).
- **configs:** Configuration files for your services.
- **scripts:** Utility scripts (e.g., build or deployment).
- **Tiltfile:** Configures Tilt to manage your local development environment.
- **docker-compose.yaml:** Spins up external dependencies like Kafka and Zookeeper for local development.
- **go.mod:** Go modules file for managing project dependencies.
